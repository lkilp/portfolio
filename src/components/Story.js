            <h3>My story</h3>
            <div>I grew up in a household where web development and advertising were discussed daily. Being present and part of film sets was my favorite, it enabled me to spend hours observing people and watch them solve creative puzzles.</div>
            <div>Challenging myself and solving problems has become a theme since then. From excelling in Mathematics and sudoku competitions, obtaining a first class honours degree in Economics, managing successful teams in the restaurant industry in different corners of the World to completing a 200 kilometer solo hike in the Himalayas and other inspiring travel adventures. I continue to enrich myself in experiences that enhance me as a person and amplify my skillset.</div>
            <div>I love learning and making things better. Whilst studying my fifth human language (Dutch) I got introduced to computer languages, a whole new World of challenges and opportunities! I have been studying front-end development with the help of Codecademy as well as being mentored and tutored by a full stack developer with over 12 years of experience in the industry (livinglogic.nl).</div>
            <div>I am excited to launch a new career as a junior front-end developer!</div>
